# Personalized-Chatbot-for-Job-Support

The objective of this project is to create a chatbot that can assist job 
seekers with various aspects of their job search, such as providing 
information on job openings, job application processes, resume writing 
tips, interview strategies, career advice, and more. 

The chatbot will be built using the ChatGPT API, which is a state-of-the-art NLP model that 
can understand natural language and generate human-like responses. 

<h1 align="centre">REQUIREMENTS</h1>
<p>1.Python: We use python as a programming language for building the application. 

2.Gradio: Gradio is the fastest way to demo your machine learning model with a 
friendly web interface. 

3.Openai: provides convenient access to the OpenAI API from applications written 
in the Python language. 

4.OS: This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent 
functionality. 

5.ChatGPT API: ChatGPT can be used to generate responses to questions, code, 
make suggestions, or provide information in a conversational manner, and it is able 
to do so in a way that is often indistinguishable from human-generated text.  

6.IDE: mainly used for writing and editing the source code.py. </p>
